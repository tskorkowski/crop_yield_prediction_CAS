# Crop Yield Prediction

All google cloud code and related files are in the 2_gc-pipeline folder.

At the moment, some of the file names are confusing, so bare with me.

crop-prediction.ipynb - gets images from google earth engine, ques of up to 3000 images
histograms.ipynb - creates histograms from the images
training.ipynb - models and training.

A lot of the code is in the serving folder.
