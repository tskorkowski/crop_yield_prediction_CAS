# Crop Yield Prediction - Project for the ETH CAS Machine Learning in Fiance and Insurance

### Problem description

Predicting crop yield is an important task from multiple perspectives. On the global and administrative level itâ€™s relevant for food security. Under the impact of growing population and climate change it is expected that globally, food demand will increase by 35% to 56%  between 2010 and 2050 while the population at risk of hunger will change from -91% to 30%. On the local level accurate estimation of crop yield helps to select the best season and plants to grow. 
There are multiple risk factors that affect the crop yield and that are difficult to manage on the individual level and hence create an opportunity for insurance and reinsurance companies to support and help distribute risk on the national and global level.
The primary aim of this project is to apply machine learning models to satellite images to predict corn crop yield in the USA. The secondary objective is to support the strategic goal of Blue Marble to build knowledge and predictive models that would allow extension of insurance coverage beyond weather risks. As parametric insurance is the main business driver of this investigation, model performance for poor harvest years is of special interest.
Blue Marble is an Impact InsurTech with a mission to bring insurance to the underserved, farming communities. They are present in Latin America, South and South-East Asia and Africa.
